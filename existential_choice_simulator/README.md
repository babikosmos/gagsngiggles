# Existential Simulator: A Digital Parable

## The Story

Every morning, you wake up and face the same question: *What kind of person will I be today?*

Not in grand, sweeping gestures—but in small moments. The choice between scrolling through beautiful images or calling your grandmother. Between buying something that makes you feel good or donating to a cause. Between the aesthetic life and the ethical life.

This app doesn't pretend you have full control. It knows something deeper: **your mood shapes your choices more than you realize.**

When you're anxious, the world tilts toward comfort, toward the aesthetic. When you're calm or reflective, you can hear the quiet voice asking *what matters?*

## How It Works

1. **Check in with yourself.** Are you Calm? Anxious? Reflective?
2. **Face the dilemma.** Aesthetic or Ethical?
3. **Press the button.** But the universe has a say too—your mood weights the dice.
4. **See the outcome:**
   - *Aesthetic* → "Pleasurable but fleeting"
   - *Ethical* → "Meaningful but costly"
5. **The app remembers.** Every choice is logged, building a map of who you are.

## The Philosophy

This isn't a productivity app. It's not trying to make you "better."

It's a mirror. A way to notice patterns. To see how you drift between beauty and duty, pleasure and purpose. To recognize that you are not one person, but many—shifting with the tides of your inner weather.

Over time, your CSV file becomes a confession. A record of all the days you chose pleasure. All the days you chose meaning. All the days you were too anxious to choose at all.

## The Data You'll Collect

- **date:** When the choice was made
- **mood:** Your emotional weather
- **choice:** What the weighted randomness decided
- **outcome:** The philosophical consequence
- **probability_used:** How likely this outcome was, given your mood
- **life_leap:** A binary score (0 = fleeting, 1 = meaningful)

## The Question It Asks

At the end of a year, what will your data say about you?

Will you see a person who lived for beauty? For duty? For some improvised dance between the two?

Or will you just see noise—proof that we are all just probability engines, trying to convince ourselves we chose anything at all?

Final Note
This app will not make you happy. It will not make you good.
But it might make you aware.
And awareness, in the end, is the only choice we truly have.
"Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response."
— Viktor Frankl (maybe)
